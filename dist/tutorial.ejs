			<p>I am currently working on an interactive tutorial feature. However, <a href="https://www.looneylabs.com">Looney Labs</a> (which I am not affiliated with) has a tutorial video that explains the mechanics of the game.</p>
			<p>Seriously, if you haven't already, you should check them out. The pieces you see in the video are an entire game system.</p>
			<p>Please also see <a href="/howThisWorks">How This Site Works</a> for more on the specifics of this website.</p>
