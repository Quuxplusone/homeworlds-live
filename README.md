# homeworlds-live

This is going to be a real-time web implementation of the two-player strategy board game (Binary) [Homeworlds](https://www.looneylabs.com/games/homeworlds), published by Looney Labs. I am not affiliated with them.

It is still in progress. Actually, assuming I did not break anything, you can start and play games and it declares a winner, but it does not store anything or have a tutorial. I just resisted putting it on GitHub because I wanted to provide proper attribution for the game (and because I was unsure about licensing).



This **implementation** of the game of Homeworlds is licensed under GPL 3.0.

### Coding style quirks
I used tabs for indentation and (almost) always end objects with a comma, like
```javascript
{
	prop1: "value1",
	prop2: 2, // <-- comma here
}
```
