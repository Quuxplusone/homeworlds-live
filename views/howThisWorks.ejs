			<h6 class="text-warning">This page only covers how this website operates. It does not cover how to play the game of Homeworlds in general.</h6>

			<h3>Lobby</h3>
			<h5>Joining Rooms</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>In the lobby you can create game rooms or join rooms that exist already.</li>
				<li>In the "join a game" view, click on a row to view details. From there you can join the room.</li>
				<li><strong>Sometimes players are invited into rooms</strong>. Invitees get priority over non-invitees.</li>
				<li>If you are invited, the room will appear orange in the table.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>Creating Rooms</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Click the "Create a game instead" button in the lobby to create a room. You can specify the time control, make the game unrated, and choose specific players to invite.</li>
				<li>Only 2-player games are supported, but you can invite more than one player (first come first serve).</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>Launch Sequence</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The owner of a room (whoever has been in it the longest) can decide to start a game.</li>
				<li>All players in the room must agree to start. If anyone declines, the start sequence is halted.</li>
				<li>When everyone (including the owner) confirms, the game starts.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>You can also watch games in progress by clicking the links in the lobby.</p>
